# FoodOrderSystem
A java based food ordering system which places an order to the restaurant keeping following constraints in the mind:
1) Each restaurant has a processing power(say P). It can process the number of items(N<=P) at a single point of time. Once it takes the order, processing power will be reduced by N.
2) An order can be placed at one restaurant. (All items should be ordered from a restaurant which has the sufficient processing power and all items should available in restaurant)
3) Place the order in a restaurant that has the lowest price of the order.
4) Processing power will be restored on the completion of an order.
